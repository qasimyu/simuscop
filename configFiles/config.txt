##------arguments for generating sequencing reads------##

## [required] fasta reference file from which reads will be sampled
ref = /path/to/ref.fa

## [required] a model file generated by "bamToProfile" utility
profile = /path/to/sample.profile

## [optional] files defining the variations (indel, SNV and CNV) to simulate
variation = /path/to/variations.txt

## [optional] file defining the SNPs to simulate
snp = /path/to/hg19_snp138_single_1based.txt

## [optional] file defining target regions for sequencing. If the argument is not specified, sequencing data of all chromosomes defined in the reference will be produced. 
target = /path/to/target_regions.bed

## [required] popolation names (comma-separated).
name = popu1, popu2, popu3

## [optional] abundance file (the agrument is noneffective if there is only one popolation defined in "name")
abundance = /path/to/abundance.txt

## [required] output directory
outputDir = /path/to/outputDir

## [optional] sequence layout, should be "SE" or "PE" (default: "SE")
layout = SE

## [optional] the number of threads to use (default: 1)
threads = 2

## [optional] print the intermediate information, should be 0 or 1 (default: 1)
verbose = 1

## [required] the length of read
readLength = 150

## [required] sequencing coverage
coverage = 30

## [optional] genome ploidy to simulate (default: 2)
ploidy = 2

## [optional] insert size for paired end sequencing (default: 350, only effective when the "layout" is set to "PE")
insertSize = 250
